The youth comprises over one-third of the Indian population which in turn constitutes a major part of the labour force of the country. The number of underprivileged youth in India who lacks education and proper guidance is so huge that according to the reports of the Financial Express only 15% of the young graduates passing out of colleges are employable; the rest are branded unemployable.

It is not their lack of theoretical knowledge that causes this. Instead, it is the lack of right skills and attitude. There is thus, an increasing concern among the leading employers of the country, about the dearth of ready-to-deliver employees. In addition, the macro perspective affirms that, it is crucial for the energy of the underprivileged youth to be channelized properly with proper direction to aid economic growth and nation building to elude their addition to family woes, social stress and national misery.

Smile Twin E- learning Programme (STeP) is such an initiative of Smile Foundation which through its e-learning education programme aims at creating a pool of young and independent people, from a section of underprivileged youth, through skill enhancement in tandem with market requirements. It is an effort towards bridging the gap between demand and supply of skilled manpower in the fast emerging services and retail sectors of modern India.

This national level programme through its livelihood projects trains the poor and underprivileged youth in English Proficiency, Basic Computer Education and Soft Skills for enhancing their prospects of employment in the fast expanding retail, hospitality and BPO sectors.

So far, 47,000 youth have been trained through the e-learning programme and 28,000 have been placed in over 200 brands through 95 operational projects across India.
