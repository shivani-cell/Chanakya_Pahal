Mission Education is a national level programme of Chanakya Foundation, an NGO for education which is committed to 
providing basic education and healthcare to underprivileged children. Chanakya Foundation, an NGO for poor child 
education believes that whether you are addressing healthcare, poverty, population control, unemployment or 
human rights, there's no better place to start than in the corridors of education. Education is both the means as
 well as the end to a better life; means, because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end 
 because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues â€“ from healthcare to appropriate social behavior to
understanding one's rights, and in the process evolve as a better citizen. 
Smile Foundation's educational initiatives include Pre-school [3-6 yrs], Non Formal Education [6-14 yrs non-school
 going], Remedial Education [6-14 yrs school going] and Bridge Course [14-18 yrs drop-outs]. It is an education
  NGOM which works for education for underprivileged children who are under difficult circumstances, such as
   child labour, children of poorest of the parents, children inflicted and affected with HIV/AIDS, street and
    runaway children, children with rare disabilities, disaster struck children and slum children. Special emphasis
     is given on girl education and women education, so that they and their families get empowered.
Since its inception in 2002, more than 232,000 underprivileged children have directly benefitted from the Mission
 Education programme
